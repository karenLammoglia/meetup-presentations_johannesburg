# History

## Rough history of `purrr`: base R

- In the beginning, there was the `apply` “family of functions”:
    - `apply()`, `lapply()`, `sapply()`, `vapply()`, `mapply()`, `rapply()`, and `tapply()`
- Problem is, you don’t know how to use them
- No, you don’t
    - Can never quite get the syntax right first time for each variant
    - Outputs are not reliably in the right format
    
## Rough history of `purrr`: `plyr`

- Along comes the `plyr` package:
    - `aaply`, `adply`, `alply`, `a_ply`, `daply`, `ddply`, `dlply`, `d_ply`, `laply`, `ldply`, `llply`, `l_ply`, `maply`, `mdply`, `mlply`, `m_ply`
- Some consistency!  
    - First character is expected input format (array, dataframe, list, multiple lists)
    - Second character is expected output format ( _ for nothing)
- Sometimes runs quite slowly
- No longer under active development
- Most useful function turned out to be ddply, which led to…

## Rough history of `purrr`: `dplyr` 

- `dplyr` can do almost everything you really wanted to do with `plyr`! 
    - *If* all you really wanted was to manipulate dataframes
- What can’t it do?  
    - Replace the `apply` functionality.  For that we need…

## `purrr`: part of the core `tidyverse` {.smaller .build}

- The `map` "family of functions" in `purrr` is highly internally consistent
    - Learn once, use everywhere
- `purrr` functions always return exactly the right type of output
    - No more heisenbugs from inconsistent simplification
- A new syntax for anonymous functions makes life easier
    - Concise and hassle-free quick functions

```{r load-purrr, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse) # loads purrr (+ others)
```

# Why `purrr`?

## `purrr::map` vs `for` loops

- Is it possible to do everything that `purrr` can do, without `purrr`?
    - Yes, but
        - it’s ugly, error prone, and a waste of your time
- `for` loops can do everything that `apply` can do, just not as neatly
- `apply` functions can do everything that `purrr` can do, just not as neatly
- Code written with `purrr` functions are neater,  cleaner, and have fewer bugs
    - [citation needed]

## The `map` function {.smaller .build}

- We have a list: `.x`
- We have a function: `.f`
- We want to call the function `.f` on every element of the list `.x`
    - Remember that vectors and data frames are lists!
- Syntax: `map(.x, .f)` 
- The `map` function will _always_ return a list
```{r echo= TRUE} 
map(c(3,5,8), sqrt)
```
# Diving in

## Example dataset {.build .smaller}

- Game of Thrones data
    - Originally from [An API of Ice and Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com/) 
    - Conveniently available offline in the `repurrrsive` package

```{r repurrrsive, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# example datasets
library(repurrrsive, quietly = TRUE)
```

```{r load-data, echo=TRUE}
library(repurrrsive, quietly = TRUE) # example datasets
library(listviewer) # to inspect lists interactively
jsonedit(got_chars) # let's look at the dataset

```

## Calling a function on each element of the list

Each element of the list is independently passed in as the first argument to the function

```{r echo=TRUE}
# define a function that works on a single element of our list
count_titles = function(x) { length(x$titles) }
# this returns a list where each element is the count of titles that the character has
map(got_chars, count_titles)
```

## Extracting by name

We can use the extract-by-name shortcut to pull out named elements of the _elements_ of our list

```{r echo=TRUE}
# use the extractor shortcut
map(got_chars, "name")
```

## Extract by position

We can use the extract-by-position shortcut to get the elements at a specific position in each of the elements in our list

```{r}
#use the extractor shortcut
map(got_chars, 3)
```

## Note: `%>%` (pipe) syntax also works well

The pipe symbol ( `%>%` ) passes the left hand side as the first argument to the right hand side
In this case, as the first argument to `map` 

```{r}
# same as before
got_chars %>%
  map(3)
```

## What if I don't want a list as output? {.build}

`purrr` provides *type-specific* `map` variants for targeting specific outut types.
`purrr` does additional checks for you, and gives helpful error messages if there's a problem

* `map_chr`, `map_lgl`, `map_int`, `map_dbl` 
* for _character_, _logical_, _integer_, _numeric_ vectors

```{r}
map_chr(got_chars[1:5], "name")
map_lgl(got_chars[1:5], "alive")
```

## Alternatively

`flatten` removes the top level of hierarchy in the list.

```{r}
map(got_chars[1:5], "name") %>% flatten_chr()
```
It's like base R's `unlist` but safer (fails out loud)

## What if I want multiple outputs? {.build .smaller}

- `map` has a `...` argument to allow you to pass additional parameters to `.f`
- Helpful hack: pass the names you want as parameters to the "`[`" function

```{r}
map(got_chars[3:8], `[`, c("name", "gender", "culture", "alive")) %>%
  jsonedit()
```

## Can't I just have a data frame? {.build}

`map_df` - if the output list's elements will all be the same _length_

```{r}
map_df(got_chars[3:8], `[`, c("name", "gender", "culture", "alive")) 
```

Notice that `map_df` automatically type converted the columns. Convenient, but not safe.

## A safer, more tedious way {.build}

```{r}
got_chars[3:8] %>% {
  tibble(
    name = map_chr(., "name"),
    gender = map_chr(., "gender"),
    culture = map_chr(., "culture"),
    alive = map_lgl(., "alive")
  )
}
```


## What if the data I need is nested?

A trick with the extractor shortcut - provide a list of how to proceed.

```{r}
# for each character, get the first element of the povBooks vector for that character
got_chars %>%
  map_chr(list("povBooks", 1))
```

## Different ways of specifying `.f` 

Pre-define the function

```{r}
make_titles = function(x, collapse) { paste(x$titles, collapse = collapse) }
got_chars[1:3] %>%
  map_chr(make_titles, ", ")
```

## Different ways of specifying `.f` 

Define an inline (anonymous) function

```{r}
got_chars[1:3] %>%
  map_chr(function(x, collapse) { paste(x$titles, collapse = collapse) }, ", ")
```

## Different ways of specifying `.f` 

`purrr`'s formula syntax

```{r}
got_chars[1:3] %>%
  map_chr( ~ paste(.x$titles, collapse = ", "))
```

Use `.x` to refer to the data

## Build a data frame from your list interactively {.smaller}

Use the `enframe` function, then add columns as necessary

```{r}
got_chars[7:10] %>%
  set_names(map_chr(got_chars[7:10], "name", "value")) %>% # give each list element a name
  enframe() %>% # treat list as data frame
  mutate(born = map_chr(value, "born"),
         alive = map_lgl(value, "alive")) # use mutate to call map functions on list columns
```

## We can also map over multiple lists together

`map2` (and `map2_dbl`, `map2_chr`, `map2_df` etc.) allows you to call a function on two lists in parallel

Syntax: `map2(.x, .y, .f, ...)`

```{r}
got_names = got_chars %>% map("name")
got_born = got_chars %>% map("born")
map2_chr(got_names, got_born, ~ paste(.x, "was born", .y, sep = " "))
```


## What if we need to process many lists in parallel?

`pmap` takes a list of input lists
Use `..1`, `..2`, `..3`, etc in formulae to refer to arguments, or predefine your function

```{r}
got_names = got_chars %>% map("name")
got_born = got_chars %>% map("born")
got_alive = got_chars %>% map("alive")
pmap_chr(list(got_names, got_born, got_alive), ~ paste(
  ..1, "was born", 
  ..2, "and is", 
  ifelse(..3, "still alive", "now dead"), 
  sep = " "))
```


## Working with just part of the list

`map_at` and `map_if` allow you to specify a _predicate function_ to decide which elements get processed.  Saves a lot of typing!

```{r}
1:5 %>% map_if(~ .x %% 2 == 0, function(z){ z/2}) %>% flatten_dbl()
1:5 %>% map_at(c(1,3,5), ~ 3 * .x + 1) %>% flatten_dbl()
```

## Turning a list "inside out"

`transpose` turns a pair of lists into a list of pairs, and vice versa

```{r}
pair_of_lists = list(a = list(1,2,3), b = list(4,5,6))
(list_of_pairs = transpose(pair_of_lists))
```
## Turning a list "inside out"

`transpose` turns a pair of lists into a list of pairs, and vice versa

```{r}
list_of_pairs = list(list(a = 1, b = 4), 
                     list(a = 2, b = 5), 
                     list(a = 3, b = 6))
(pair_of_lists = transpose(list_of_pairs))
```

## Other useful features

I haven't used these myself but they are good to know about

* `modify` (`modify_if`, `modify_at`, `modify_depth`) for making changes to list elements
* `walk` (`walk2`, `pwalk`) for calling a function for side-effects
* `imap` for working with both the list elements and the index of the elements
* `lmap` for working with sub-lists rather than list elements
* `accumulate` and `reduce` for summarising lists into a single value iteratively
* `invoke_map` for calling a list of functions, each with potentially different arguments 


## Recap

We've seen that `purrr` allows us to:

* Call functions on each element of an arbitrary list
* Extract single values at any point in the hierarchy by name or position
* Get type-safe outputs
* Define and call functions
    * On the every element of the list
    * On parts of the list
    * On multiple lists in parallel
* Transform the structure of a list
